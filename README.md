## Data structures project

In this project i have created a generic hash table as well a generic undirected graph using that hash table implementation

In modules directory you will find : 
  - The directory hash-tables where and the hash table has been implemented
  - The directory graphs where the graph has been implemented
  - The directory dictionary in which a function for finding shortest path (Dijksta) in a graph is implemented with
  
  Also i have created 2 main directories in which main functions exist to test the function of modules directory
